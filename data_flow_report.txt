Data Flow Report:

User Authentication:

Users register or sign in through the auth pages (/app/auth/).
Credentials are sent to the API routes (/app/api/auth/).
NextAuth.js handles authentication, creating sessions and tokens.
User data is stored in and retrieved from MongoDB using the User schema (/schemas/user.ts).


Dashboard and Ticket Management:

The main dashboard (/app/dashboard/page.tsx) displays ticket statistics and a ticket table.
Ticket data is fetched from the API (/app/api/ticket/route.ts) and displayed using the data-table component.
New tickets are created via the new-ticket-button component, sending data to /app/api/ticket/new/route.ts.
Bulk actions on tickets are handled by /app/api/ticket/bulk/route.ts.
Individual ticket operations use the dynamic route /app/api/ticket/[ticketid]/route.ts.


Map Integration:

The map component (/components/map.tsx) integrates with Google Maps API.
Ticket locations are displayed on the map using marker_flag.png.
Map dialogs (/components/dialog/map-dialog.tsx) show detailed location information.


Image Handling:

Ticket photos are uploaded to Firebase storage (configured in /lib/firebase.ts).
Photo URLs are stored in the ticket documents in MongoDB.
Photos are displayed using the photo-modal component.


Data Models:

Ticket and User models are defined in /types/index.ts.
MongoDB schemas in /schemas/ ensure data integrity.


API Structure:

API routes in /app/api/ handle all server-side operations.
These routes interact with MongoDB for data persistence.
They also communicate with Firebase for image storage.


State Management:

React's useState and useEffect hooks manage local component state.
Context API (auth-context.tsx) handles global authentication state.


Responsive Design:

Tailwind CSS (configured in tailwind.config.ts) is used for responsive styling.
Components are designed to be responsive across devices.


Error Handling and Notifications:

Alert modals and toast notifications inform users of operation outcomes.
Error states are managed and displayed throughout the application.



This application demonstrates a full-stack Next.js architecture with TypeScript, integrating MongoDB for data storage, Firebase for image handling, and Google Maps for location services. The modular component structure and API route system allow for scalable and maintainable code, while the use of TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the project.
